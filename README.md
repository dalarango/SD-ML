# SD-ML
#### This repo makes use of PySD (https://github.com/JamesPHoughton/pysd) to integrate System Dynamics models into Python to allow a better interaction between dynamic systems modelling and various machine learning techniques.
#### This is a project made for fun :) thus, it is not intended to provide any particular service :)
