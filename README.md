# SD-ML
#### This repo makes use of PySD to integrate System Dynamics models into Python to allow a better interaction between dynamic systems modelling and various machine learning techniques.
#### This is a project made for fun :) thus, it is not intended to provide any particular service beyond maybe being interesting to those few who find the interaction between SD and ML interesting :)
